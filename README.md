# Chinese Card Generator

The **Chinese Card Generator** is a Python package designed to streamline the process of creating **Anki flashcards** for learning Chinese. It combines LLM-generated content with customized Python processing to turn lists of Chinese words into formatted Anki cards, making it easier to review and learn new Chinese vocabulary.

This package assists in:
1. Requesting an LLM to generate related content, including example sentences, synonyms, and dictionary definitions, for a list of Chinese words.
2. Processing the generated content using Python scripts to format it into Anki-compatible flashcards.
3. Adding helpful tone markings on Chinese characters and generating fields such as **pinyin**, **translations**, **example sentences**, and **synonyms** to enhance language learning.

## Examples

### From English to Chinese:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="resources/en_zh_桥梁_front.jpg" alt="Front" style="width: 32%;">
  <img src="resources/en_zh_桥梁_back_hidden.jpg" alt="Back Hidden" style="width: 32%;">
  <img src="resources/en_zh_桥梁_back.jpg" alt="Back" style="width: 32%;">
</div>

### From Chinese to English:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 20px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="resources/zh_en_下划线_front.jpg" alt="Front" style="width: 32%;">
  <img src="resources/zh_en_下划线_back_hidden.jpg" alt="Back Hidden" style="width: 32%;">
  <img src="resources/zh_en_下划线_back.jpg" alt="Back" style="width: 32%;">
</div>

## Card details

The card features five buttons that offer useful tools to enrich your learning experience by providing access to additional resources and controls:

1. **Synonyms**:  
   This button links to Pleco, where it performs a search for synonyms of the main word on the card. It helps you expand your vocabulary by presenting related words with similar meanings.

2. **Dictionary**:  
   Clicking this button opens Pleco to display the dictionary definition of the main word. It provides detailed information such as meanings, examples, and related terms.

3. **Unhide**:  
   The "Unhide" button reveals or hides specific hidden elements on the card, such as pinyin and color-coded examples for both the dictionary and sentence sections. It allows you to challenge yourself by trying to pronounce the word or sentence tones before revealing the correct pinyin.

4. **Word**:  
   This button searches for the word itself in Pleco, providing detailed information about its usage, pronunciation, and meaning, including its appearance in different dictionary contexts.

5. **Sentence**:  
   This button links to Pleco, showing a search result for the example sentence on the card. It gives further context for the word by illustrating how it's used in real sentences.

These buttons seamlessly integrate with the Pleco dictionary app, giving you quick access to detailed explanations, synonyms, and contextual examples to support your Chinese learning journey.

## Workflow

1. **Install Anki**:
   - Download and install the Anki application, available for **Windows**, **macOS**, **Android**, and **iOS** platforms. Visit the [official Anki website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) to download the version for your device.
   - After installation, consider creating an account to sync your decks across devices.
   - If you are on Android or iOS, you can install `Pleco` in order to leverage the [buttons](#examples) I created to lookup more in detail the characters.

2. **Import Deck**:
   - To get started, import the `deck.apkg` file into your Anki library:
     - In Anki, go to `File > Import` and select the `deck.apkg` file.
     - The deck will be added to your Anki collection, ready for use.

3. **Prepare the List of Words**:
   - Create a text file containing a list of Chinese words you want to study. This file will serve as input for generating detailed flashcard content using a large language model. I personally use the [Zhongwen Browser Extension](#additional-tools) to gather the vocabulary.
   - Example of the format for the word list:
     ```plaintext
     向量 vector
     矩阵 matrix
     ...
     ```

    a

4. **Seed list creation**:

    ~~~plaintext
    ### Prompt for Seed List Creation:
   
    Please create a verified list of Chinese words, ensuring accuracy and clarity in each entry. For each word:
    
        1. **Double-check the Chinese characters** (both simplified and traditional, if applicable).
        2. **Confirm the pinyin transcription**, ensuring proper spacing and tone markings.
        3. **Provide a concise English translation** (e.g., one or two words) that reflects the most common meaning of the word in context.

    Exclude any words that are:
        - Unclear, ambiguous, or have meanings that are not straightforward.
        - Rare, overly technical, or context-dependent in ways that might not be intuitive.

    The final table should have the following columns:

        1. **Simplified Characters**: The simplified version of the Chinese characters.
        2. **Traditional Characters**: The traditional version of the Chinese characters.
        3. **Pinyin**: The pinyin transcription of the Chinese word, with **one space** between each syllable and **proper tone markings**.
        4. **Meaning**: A simple, clear English translation in one or two words.

    Use the provided list as input, and output only those entries that are confirmed to be accurate and clear.

5. **LLM Query**:
   - Use the following prompt with an LLM to generate the necessary content for each word in your list. You can do that by copying the following prompt, append the word list at the end, and send it manually in an LLM conversation such as on [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?model=gpt-4o).

   ~~~plaintext
   ### Prompt:
   
   Please create a tab-separated table for the given list of Chinese words. Each entry should include the following columns:
   
   1.  **Simplified Characters**: The simplified version of the Chinese characters.
   2.  **Traditional Characters**: The traditional version of the Chinese characters.
   3.  **Pinyin**: The pinyin transcription of the Chinese word, with **one space** between each syllable. If the word consists of multiple distinct conceptual parts that are often spaced in dictionaries (e.g., '全球定位系统' which is 'quán qiú dìng wèi xì tǒng'), use **two spaces** to separate these parts (e.g., 'quán qiú  dìng wèi  xì tǒng'). For most common words (e.g. '银行', '朋友'), single spaces between syllables are sufficient (e.g., 'yín háng', 'péng you').
   4.  **Meaning**: The English meaning or translation of the word.
   5.  **Sentence Example**: A simple example sentence using the word in Chinese. Ensure this sentence provides good context for the word, especially if it's a polyphonic character. 
   6.  **Sentence Meaning**: The English translation of the example sentence.
   7.  **Synonym**: Up to three synonyms for the word, formatted as "SimplifiedCharacters (Pinyin) - Translation", separated by `<br>`. The pinyin in parentheses here should be for the synonym itself.
   8.  **DictionarySimplified**: A short definition of the word in Chinese characters, giving a brief explanation of the term's meaning.
   9.  **DictionaryMeaning**: The English translation of the definition, giving a brief explanation of the term's meaning.
   
   Use the above structure to create the table for each entry from the provided list of words.

   ### Example Input
   
   ```
   - 向量 (vector)
   - 矩阵 (matrix)
   - ...
   ```
   
   -----
   
   ### Example Output
   
   ```tsv
   Simplified Characters	Traditional Characters	Pinyin	Meaning	Sentence Example	Sentence Meaning	Synonym	DictionarySimplified	DictionaryMeaning
   向量	向量	xiàng liàng	vector	我们需要计算这个向量的长度。	We need to calculate the length of this vector.	矢量 (shǐ liàng) - vector<br>量向 (liàng xiàng) - vector	数学中用于表示方向和大小的对象	object used in mathematics to represent direction and magnitude
   矩阵	矩陣	jǔ zhèn	matrix	这个矩阵的行列式为零。	The determinant of this matrix is zero.	方阵 (fāng zhèn) - square matrix	由数或变量排列成的矩形阵列	rectangle array formed by numbers or variables
   ```

   ### Tips for Generating the Table:
   
   1.  **Contextual Example Sentences**: The `Sentence Example` should clearly demonstrate the usage of the word, which is especially important for words with multiple meanings or pronunciations (polyphonic characters). The sentence should help infer the correct context.
   2.  **Synonym Formatting**: For the `Synonym` column, ensure each synonym follows the "SimplifiedCharacters (Pinyin) - Translation" format, with `<br>` separating multiple synonyms.
   3.  **Short but Descriptive Definitions**: The `DictionarySimplified` and `DictionaryMeaning` columns should provide concise but informative definitions.
   4.  **Accuracy**: Make sure traditional and simplified characters are accurately paired, and translations and meanings reflect the specific terms.
   5.  **Simplicity in Sentences**: For `Sentence Example`, do not put any special characters or numbers beyond standard Chinese characters, commas (，), and full stops (。). This helps avoid processing issues.
   6.  **Word Spacing in Chinese Text**: For `Sentence Example` and `DictionarySimplified`, **insert a single space between all Chinese words**.
   7.  **Formatting**: Return only the table, exactly the way I formatted the output, with a tab separating the entries.
   
   ### Word List

   <<WORD LIST HERE>>
   ~~~

   This will generate a table with all necessary fields for the flashcards.
   [Here](https://chatgpt.com/share/6513c81e-73af-476b-b6d8-cffaeb83652f) is an example of conversation to get the word list. Also [`./data/input.tsv`](./data/input.tsv) is an example of word list generated.

6. **Data Processing**:
   - Once you receive the generated data from the LLM, save it as a `.tsv` file and process it with the `zhongwen-anki` package:
     ```bash
     zhongwen-anki -i 'input_file_path' -o 'output_file_path'
     ```
   - Replace `input_file_path` with the path to your input `.tsv` file and `output_file_path` with your desired output path for the processed data.

7. **Import Processed Data into Anki**:
   - Import the processed `.tsv` file into Anki by selecting `File > Import` and choosing the file. Make sure the fields are correctly mapped before importing.

8. **Start Learning**:
   - Begin reviewing your new flashcards. Adjust your Anki settings for optimal learning based on your preferences (see recommendations below).

## Anki Add-ons

Here are some recommended Anki add-ons to enhance your learning experience:

- **[Auto Ease Factor](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1672712021)** or **[Reset Ease](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/947935257)**: These add-ons help prevent you from falling into [Ease Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roR8S9zjUh8), where cards become harder to review due to the scheduling algorithm.
- **[Review Heatmap](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1771074083)**: Visualize your past and future review activity with this helpful heatmap, which can motivate you to stay consistent.

You can find additional add-ons on the [Anki add-ons page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1).

## Additional Tools

[Zhongwen Browser Extension](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen) is a Chinese pop-up dictionary available for browsers like Chrome and Firefox. It’s an excellent tool for quickly translating Chinese words by hovering over them with your mouse.

- **Quick Vocabulary Addition**: Press `R` while hovering over a word to instantly add it to your vocabulary list.
- **Access Your List**: Use `Alt + W` to view the vocabulary list you've built.

This tool is especially useful for quickly identifying and understanding new Chinese words as you browse the web. Additionally, it’s great for **easily creating a list of words** that can be used in the tool you’re setting up. By building a personalized vocabulary list as you encounter new words, you can seamlessly integrate these words into the flashcard generation process, making it easier to create your own Anki deck.

## Notes

- **Card Themes**: Although the cards should function in various themes (light, plain, dark), they are specifically optimized for the **black theme** in Anki. Consider switching to the black theme for the best experience.
- **Anki Scheduling**: Anki's scheduling system is crucial to effective learning. Be sure to explore and customize the intervals, learning steps, and other settings to match your personal learning style. This can significantly improve retention and reduce burnout.
  - Customize the number of new cards per day and review limits based on your time commitment and learning capacity.
  - Regularly assess your progress and adjust settings like ease and intervals to optimize long-term retention.
- **Deck Backup**: Always back up your Anki decks regularly to prevent data loss. Use Anki’s sync feature with AnkiWeb, or manually export `.apkg` files.
